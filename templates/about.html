          Hey there, I'm Joseph Paintsil, but you can call me Joey. Here's a quick peek into who I am:
          I'm a young, ambitious guy fueled by the desire to succeed. I believe that even though the journey of a thousand mile begins with a
          single step, it also ends with a single step. As such, I take each day one step at a time
          knowing that one day,with God by my side, I will finally step into greatness.

        </p>
